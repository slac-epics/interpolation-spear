NOTES for dynamic interpolation

The basic utility is located in Dynamic_InterpolationSup. It comprises
the aSub record support code and dbd file. There are some reasonable comments
in Dynamic_InterpolationSup/dynamic_interpolation_subroutines.c

Some examples of its use are found in:
Feed_Forward_CommonApp
Feed_Forward_Sector_05App
Feed_Forward_Sector_14App

Sector 5 is a 1D interpolation based on the ID gap.
Sector 14 is a 3D interpolation based on  phase-mode, phase and gap.

Feed_Forward_CommonApp/Db/Quadrupole_Interpolation_Calculations.template
contains the actual aSub records used to perform the interpolation.

Each aSub record can calculate 12 trim currents. The breaks point
coordinated are the same for all 12 interpolations.
